    <desc>Golden Tee Fore! Complete is a golf game and part on a long series, whose signature feature is the use of a trackball to determine the power, direction and curve of the player's golf shot. Play modes include casual 18-hole golf, closest to the pin, and online tournaments.

As with most golfing games, players have a full selection of clubs from which to choose, although the game will always suggest a club for each shot. Wind strength and direction must be accounted for when choosing the club and making the shot. The game also has dynamic weather in the form of light rain showers, these affect both the way the courses play and visibility. An on-screen indicator shows both the direction and strength of the wind during open play, with another indictor showing the angle and elevation of the putting green once the player has reached it.</desc>

    <desc>Virtua Striker 2 is a football game. Players compete as 1 of 32 international teams, detailed down to the members' uniforms and playing styles. As the most dedicated soccer fanatic expects, the gameplay is highly detailed and the action is fast and furious. The realistic, motion-captured players perform a plethora of stylish moves, including bicycle kicks, headers, and slide tackles. One cool feature: as the virtual clock ticks away the hours from morning through evening, the environmental lighting adjusts accordingly. Of course, a social game like soccer is twice as fun with a fellow Pelé wannabe, which is why there's a head-to-head two-person multiplayer mode.</desc>

As the name implies, it is loosely based on (and not licensed by) the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you have to go for the gold to get to the next event. However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event.</desc>

    <desc>Track &amp;amp; Field © 1983 Konami.

Track &amp;amp; Field is an athletics-themed action game for up to four players, who compete against each other in six track and field-based disciplines. 

The game controls consist of two run buttons (one for each &amp;#039;leg&amp;#039; of the athlete) and one &amp;#039;Action&amp;#039; button. Players must hit the two run buttons alternately to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or minimum score threshold that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. failing to qualify (in one heat for track events or in three attempts in the other events) will reduce the players&amp;#039; number of lives by one, the game is over once all lives are lost.

Track &amp;amp; Field can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs in the running events and individually in the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performance of the players has no effect on the game and advancing is based solely on reaching qualifying times and targets.

The six events are:

100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is the optimum angle).
JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (43 is the optimum angle).
110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is the optimum angle).
HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar; just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.</desc>

    <desc>Konami '88 (also known as '88 Games or Hyper Sports Special) is the third in the Track &amp; Field game series by Konami, where you test your Olympic skills against other world-class athletes. As the name implies, it is loosely based on (and not licensed by) the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you have to go for the gold to get to the next event. However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event.</desc>

    <name>10-Yard Fight</name>
    <desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

    <name>2020 Super Baseball</name>
    <desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.

    <name>720°</name>
    <desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls.

    <desc>Clutch Hitter is a baseball game originally released for Sega System 18 hardware before being ported to the Sega Game Gear. The Game Gear version was only released in North America.

There are noticeable differences between the Japanese and US versions of the arcade game - the US version has a MLB license and uses US teams, while the Japanese version opts for Japanese players and teams. There are also subtle changes to the presentation to reflect the two regions. A Chicken Leg, an enemy seen in Altered Beast and Golden Axe, makes a cameo appearance in the results screen.

Clutch Hitter is considered to be an entry in the Super League series of baseball games, directly inspiring the improvements Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 made to Super League.</desc>

    <desc>
Combat School is multi-event combat-themed sports game for one or two players, similar in gameplay style to Konami's earlier Track and Field games. Players must compete in a series of boot-camp style events under the watchful eye of the strict drill instructor, with the ultimate aim of completed all events and graduating as a full soldier.

The game is composed of seven training events, each of which must be completed within a set time to progress to the next. If players only narrowly miss out on qualifying in an event, they must complete a set number of chin-ups as punishment. If they manage this within the time limit, they can progress to the next event. This only occurs once per round, however.

    <name>Escape Kids</name>
    <desc>Escape Kids © 1991 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

An unusual take on the overhead racing genre, Escape Kids has up to 4 players taking on the role of an athletic runner and competing to be the first to cross the finish line in a number of 3-lap races. As well as running, each player has a limited number of &amp;#039;Super Jumps&amp;#039;; these allow the player to leap over both rival runners and obstacles.

Money is awarded for finishing first, and players can upgrade their runner depending on the amount of money they have available. Runners can be given extra super jumps, an upgrade to stop the runner from skidding when going through a bend in the track, quicker recovery time from falls, or be made stronger (and thus less likely to be knocked over by a rival runner). Special items occasionally appear and can be picked up and used. These range from an item that causes a small earthquake (causing all of the rival runners to tumble along the ground, thus slowing them down) and a bomb, which renders any runner that runs into it unable to move for several seconds.

Each race has a total of five competitors (either human or computer controlled) and players must finish in first place or are disqualified. Any player who wins all three races in a round will be taken to a bonus screen. Here, the player&amp;#039;s on-screen counterpart rides a bike and the player must collect as much money as possible.</desc>

    <name>Exciting Soccer</name>
    <desc>Exciting Soccer is an association football game which includes penalty shootout if the game ends in a tie. If you win the game you move on to the next level, each time the opponent gets harder to beat. When you start playing you can choose one of 6 teams: Italy, England, Brazil, West Germany, Austria, or France. The sequel Exciting Soccer II was released in 1984 with Japan replacing Austria and new music, but identical gameplay. 

The game allows for one or two players to play and has a control scheme where they can tackle, shoot, short pass, and long pass. Exciting Soccer had realistic touches for the time: corner kicks, throw-ins, penalty shots, and cheerleaders, as well as digitized voices and an influential overhead view.</desc>

    <name>Gridiron Fight</name>
    <desc>Tehkan Gridiron Fight is a two-dimensional top-down scrolling American football game in which the player(s) control the virtual player on their team who is closest to the ball, with the trackball determining the speed and direction at which the player runs. A single push-button labeled "Kick" causes the virtual player in possession to release the ball with the same force and direction in which he is currently running. (This button is duplicated on either side of the trackball for left or right-handed players.) The Player 1 (red trackball) side contained two additional push-buttons for choosing between Single or Two-Player games. Before each play, players are invited to select from a variety of formations, e.g. "Sweep" or "Draw". The formation selected is displayed on a seven-segment LED on the player's control panel.

Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the height of the ball can be determined by its growing larger while its shadow appears on the ground. Also on the side of the screen is the score and a clock which counts down to zero, the point where the current game ends.</desc>

    <name>Hit The Ice</name>
    <desc>Welcome to no holds barred hockey brought to you by the Video Hockey League.  It's the Reds versus the Blues, the VHL's biggest rivalry.

The same hockey rules apply, pass the puck around around the ice rink and shoot it past the opposite goalie to score. You can also check your opponent just like real hockey, only each character has their own bone-crushing way of checking, each with maximum impact and zero tolerance for your well-being.  Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up.

For an additional credit, players can purchase a 'power drink' that will make them 'Skate Faster and Shoot Harder' at the start of the period for one minute.

Now get to the action and DROP THAT PUCK!</desc>

In simpler times, this might have inspired people to head out to a track or gymnasium to try their stuff, but now for the first time an industry was poised to let the hands of the middle-class masses do all the work virtually, through joysticks, needing no facilities or specialised equipment (beyond a video game console) to try the whole gamut of events.</desc>

Hyper Athlete uses the three-button control system of its predecessors (two RUN buttons and one ACTION button per player) and the 11 disciplines can be attempted in any order. The available events are:

Playing much like Namco's own World Stadium franchise, each player has direct control over their players in batting, pitching, and fielding. The game offers 38 different fictional teams in six leagues, as well as six different stadiums to play in, ranging from regular stadiums, to stadiums in desert and arctic conditions, and even a stadium on top of a boat!
The game also offers a single-player "World Tour" mode, as well as exhibition modes for one or two players. Roster changes can also be made much like R.B.I. Baseball, and games can be set to play anywhere from one to twenty-one innings long.</desc>

While the traditional rules of soccer are present, the player is able to charge kick power to control how far the ball flies across the field.

The game ends if the player loses or manages to beat all the opposing teams.</desc>

The most important addition is a versus mode against another human players. The unnamed wrestler protagonist from the original version is now called Dynamite Tommy. In the versus mode he only can fight a clone character with identical moves known as Hurricane Joe.
In the single-player mode the roster from the original game has been made smaller. Dynamite Tommy has to fight Insane Warrior, Golden Hulk and Hurricane Joe (except when continuing a two-player game in single-player as Joe, then Tommy is an opponent). The three other wrestlers Karate Fighter, Coco Savage and The Pirania are no longer available as opponents. After completing the game all three of them can be fought again in an endless loop.</desc>

    <name>Muscle Bomber Duo : Ultimate Team Battle</name>
    <desc>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations.

In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA?s first champion.

One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the ?Crash Carnival,? to decide the new king of the CPWA.

The gong that determines the new ?Master of Muscle Bomber? is sounded?</desc>

    <desc>An athletics game featuring 8 tournaments:

Interceptor
A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a "Track and Field"-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over.</desc>

    <desc>Paddle Mania is a top-down tennis game with an Olympic twist. When playing through the game's single-player and cooperative modes, players will alternate between taking on fellow tennis players on gimmicky courts and competing against athletes from other sports. Despite the tennis theming, scoring works more similarly to air hockey, with a goal on both sides of the court that the teams need to defend and aim for. The Olympic athletes you face off with range from a volleyball team to surfers to a single sumo wrestler, while the gimmicks against the tennis players include things such as a goal that opens and shuts periodically, one that has a barrier preventing you from standing inside it, and one where parts of the goal is blocked by a moving wall. By swinging your racket right and left you need to get more points than your opponent to move onto the next athlete. There is a multiplayer option where you compete against each other instead of cooperate, and while you both play as tennis athletes still, you can select from the different gimmick courts featured in the single player mode.</desc>

    <desc>Paperboy © 1984 Atari Games.

Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy&amp;#039;s customers from Monday through to Sunday. 

Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy&amp;#039;s customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer&amp;#039;s mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer&amp;#039;s property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy&amp;#039;s customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe.

Non-customers&amp;#039; houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the "Breakage Bonus", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). 

If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer&amp;#039;s house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy&amp;#039;s route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. 

Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player&amp;#039;s score. 

While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, Paperboy can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life. 

In addition to the obstacles, non-subscribers are hostile towards Paperboy and will attack him and try to knock him down. If Paperboy damages a subscriber&amp;#039;s property, that character may also attack. So the more customers that are lost, the more hostile the neighborhood becomes toward Paperboy. 

At the end of each delivery day, players have a chance to sharpen their skills by guiding Paperboy through the Paperboy Training Grounds. This obstacle course is filled with various targets at which to throw newspaper, as well as ramp jumps to be negotiated. This is a bonus round and no lives are lost for failing to reach the finish line.</desc>

    <desc>Premier Soccer is a soccer game where you select a team and try to get them to the final and win it. You first select which continent you want to play in before selecting a country from that continent. You also have four choices of how close you want the camera to be when playing.

The actual match is played from a top-down side view where the pitch scrolls where the player with the ball moves. All the usual football rules are there with free-kicks, penalties, throw-ins and corners. The ref will also make an appearance if a yellow or red card is brandished. You control a player with a joystick and various fie-buttons to select different kicks or tackles. Win the game and it's on to the next round and a harder opponent.</desc>

    <desc>Punk Shot takes up to four players to downtown NYC for some two-on-two street basketball, no referee, no rules. The opposing two-man teams face off for a match played in four quarters (2 to 5 minutes each), on improvised courts in 3 different locations: the alley, the park, and the harbor.

Naturally, it ain't just about being cool and shooting some b-ball outside of the school: on each side you have a couple of guys who are up to no good, with a constant enthusiasm for making trouble in the neighborhood. As such, Punk Shot joyfully turns basketball into a full-contact sport - heads will be bashed, noses punched, and private parts kicked. To top it off, each court features an assortment of environmental hazards, from slippery banana peels and having your butt set on fire, to the park dogs and their special taste for pants.</desc>

You control the timing of your jump with the Jump button, at which point your parachutist begins hurtling toward the ground out of control. Pressing the D-Ring button shortly afterwards releases the chute and slows your descent. More importantly, it allows you at this point to control your left/right position via the paddle control to help you avoid the enemies.</desc>

    <name>Robot Bowl</name>
    <desc>You have a top down view of a bowling alley with score cards shown on each side. The only thing in the game that uses an actual animation is the bowler himself, the robot has a several frame animation when he walks. Everything is (of course) shown in glorious monochrome black and white. The game begins with your robot bowler running up to the alley (his feet move faster than he does, which makes it look like he is running on a conveyor belt or something). You then have three seconds to roll the ball, before it will roll of its own accord. The game is controlled with five buttons, they are left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. When Exidy was making this game, they had to make a decision about how the hooking worked, and it seems that they decided that "Robots are telepaths, and can effect the balls movement after it is thrown!". You see you can't even hook the ball until after it is thrown. This makes it very easy to pick up the spare. The game makes up for that little trick by making 'splits' very common (the 7-10 split and the 4-7-10 split come up all the time). These are pretty annoying, but you can usually learn how to clear them out (except the 7-10 split, I still haven't figured out how to clear that one).</desc>

    <desc>Rollergames is the name of two 1990 Konami video games, one a coin-operated arcade game by, the other a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and both based on the television show of the same name. This arcade game is faithful to the show unlike the NES version of RollerGames, which is a side-scrolling game. The game is for two players and features all the skaters and managers from the league.

Score values are cut in half from the real show (and rounded up if needed), and feature only four 99-second cycles instead of 45-second cycles within four 6-minute periods.

    <desc>Super Dodgeball uses the same basic gameplay used in the other games in the series with some minor differences. The game puts you in control of a team of 3 characters (with you controlling the lead character or the one with the ball at the time) that must defeat a selection of other teams in order to become the champion. This time around the teams are all formed by characters from the Nekketsu Kunio Kun universe, each representing different suburbs of Tokyo that compete in an amusement park for the ultimate title. Each character has their unique stats and special moves, which now depend on a power bar that can be charged-up by holding both attack buttons.</desc>

    <name>Super Football Champ</name>
    <desc>A spiritual sequel to Hat Trick Hero, Super Football Champ is pure arcade action that deflates the idea that all video soccer games must be a serious simulation of the sport. SFC is the type of football game that you would spend your loose change on for an hour or so in the arcades before scoffing a packet of chips on the way home. The in-game graphics are typically arcade with bulky polygon players plodding around the pitch, pushing and shoving for possession of the ball. Although they appear as a squad of numbered clones, your star player does stand out from the crowd with his individual features and hair style (not forgetting to mention the flashing 'Ace' arrow over his head). There are 30 International teams to choose from with the skill set at the level of their real-life counterparts.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

    <desc>The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.</desc>

    <name>Tropical Angel</name>
    <desc>An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.</desc>

    <desc>In this timed abstract racing game, a single player controls a water-skier who is being pulled along behind a power-boat. The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.

The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat's speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also occasional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.</desc>

    <desc>The title of the game is mostly self-explanatory, as it is wrestling game with an all-Japanese cast of fighters. The game is licensed title, based on the real "All Japan Pro Wrestling" (Zen Nihon Puroresu) wrestling promotion. The "featuring Virtua"-part of the title is related to the implementation of Wolf and Jeffrey from the game Virtua Fighter as playable characters.

Like Virtua Fighter, the graphics of the game are fully in 3D. The action is shown from changing perspectives. There is a large variety of moves available; apart from basic like attack or hold (which can also be modified with the D-pad) there are also taunts and counter moves available, for example. Furthermore, the game features a injury system: when a high amount of damage is inflicted, the game pauses shortly to show an X-ray picture and the increased damage of the corresponding section of the body.

Apart from single player mode, the game also features a multiplayer and a training mode.</desc>

    <name>Arm Wrestling</name>
    <desc>In Arm Wrestling, the player takes on a number of different, distinctly cartoon-like opponents in a series of arm wrestling matches. The game's graphical styling is very similar to Nintendo's classic "Punch-Out!!" series. Gameplay requires that the player initially pushes the joystick to the left, but whenever the computer opponent starts to act, the player must push the joystick to the right to counter-attack, and press the button to increase power. If the counterattack is unsuccessful, moving the joystick back and forth several times will prevent the player from being pinned. The player's opponent must be pinned before the counter reaches one minute, or the match will be lost.</desc>

    <name>Baseball Stars 2</name>
    <desc>This follow up to Baseball Stars Professional features a fast-paced arcade style baseball with six fictitious teams, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  There are two difficulties of play: Beginner, which automatically fields the ball for the player while Exciting has the player do the field manually.  Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.

The standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.</desc>

During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.

The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.</desc>

    <name>Super Punch-out!!</name>
    <desc>Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. 

As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. 

Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. 

Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.</desc>

    <name>10-Yard Fight</name>
    <desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

    <desc>Track &amp;amp; Field © 1983 Konami.

Track &amp;amp; Field is an athletics-themed action game for up to four players, who compete against each other in six track and field-based disciplines. 

The game controls consist of two run buttons (one for each &amp;#039;leg&amp;#039; of the athlete) and one &amp;#039;Action&amp;#039; button. Players must hit the two run buttons alternately to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or minimum score threshold that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. failing to qualify (in one heat for track events or in three attempts in the other events) will reduce the players&amp;#039; number of lives by one, the game is over once all lives are lost.

Track &amp;amp; Field can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs in the running events and individually in the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performance of the players has no effect on the game and advancing is based solely on reaching qualifying times and targets.

The six events are:

100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is the optimum angle).
JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (43 is the optimum angle).
110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is the optimum angle).
HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar; just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.</desc>

    <name>Major Title 2</name>
    <desc>Major Title 2 is a golf game for up to four players who choose to play as one of four different golfers. Each golfer possesses a unique skill-set that influences their ability to make certain types of shots (power hitter, all-round player, technician and magician). 

The game offers a choice of two different courses and provides the usual array of game modes: tournament, match play, stroke play and a skins game.

During play, the action is presented in two different perspectives. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from behind the golfer but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. Once players are on the green, a window is displayed showing a zoomed-in overhead view detailing the green's contours. 

Major Title 2 takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which sets the amount of back or topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. 

Draw and fade can also be applied to the ball by changing the players stance prior to taking the shot. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards, but measures distance on the greens in meters.</desc>

    <desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls.

    <desc>Skydiver © 1978 Atari.

This is quite a fun game, where you score points for landing on an ever decreasing patch of &amp;#039;good&amp;#039; land. Why &amp;#039;good&amp;#039;? As you descend without opening your parachute your landing point becomes smaller, but the points become higher, just don&amp;#039;t leave pulling the ripcord too late because the Newtonian laws concerning gravity is working against you. Each time you successfully land the plane goes lower.</desc>

    <desc>Extremely rare, this game is based on the classic manga/anime series Ashita no Joe (Tomorrow's Joe). The manga ran from 1968 to 1973 in Shonen Magazine. There were also 2 TV series that ran from 1970 to 1971 and 1980 to 1981 and a movie was released in 1980.
